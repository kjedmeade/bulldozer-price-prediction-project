You can use dd (meaning d twice) to delete cells, but I just use x instead.

Edit Mode:
Ctrl+Shift+-: Split the current cell at the cursor
Cmd+z (Mac), Ctrl+z (Windows): Undo text edits or deletions
Tab: Code completion (when writing code) or indent (at the start of a line)
You can also use standard text editor keyboard shortcuts for cut, copy, and paste.
